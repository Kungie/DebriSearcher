# DebriSearcher

The aim of our project is to locate and decrease the level of marine debris by using artificial intelligence and machine learning. In order to comprehend the concept of our project, we need a deep understanding of AI and ML and how do they work.

# WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?

Artificial intelligence is the common name of a program that leverages computers to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of human minds.[1] AI is not as perfect as human minds but that makes it more useful and easy to use since it can be used for particular purposes.

# WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?

Machine learning is an area of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to mimic the way humans learn, with the goal of steadily improving accuracy.[2] Machine learning is similar to our brain and neural system. It was developed by Arthur Samuel in 1959. [3]

# HOW DOES NEURAL SYSTEMS IN MACHINE LEARNING WORK?

Neural network in machine learning is not different from the human neural system. There are at least 3 columns of neurons with similar but different functions. Those columns are named input, processor, and output neurons. input and output neurons are called visible layers which is necessary for all neural networks. Processor neurons are called hidden layers and can have more columns than other layers. The number of layers and neurons are the main factors for efficiency in machine learning.

After preparing AI and ML bot for our app, we will use the bot to find the locations of polluted areas visually. The data that we get from the bot will contain 5 pieces of information.

# DEPTH OF THE SEA/OCEAN

Knowledge about sea level and depth are important for our bot to predict the best solution. For our purposes, our bot will use a visual prediction method for undersea level and depth. Normally, according to NASA's statement [5], satellites are used in the calculation of depth but our bot will estimate the level by its color tone.

# THE DENSITY OF PLASTIC POLLUTION

The plastic density of a polluted area is also an important factor for our AI. Density is a necessity for our bot to choose between governmental and communal solutions.

# DISTANCE BETWEEN CLOSEST SEASHORE AND POLLUTED AREA

The horizontal distance between polluted area and closest coast is important for better predictions. The recommended solution might change according to distance.

# DIAMETER OF POLLUTED AREA

Finding the diameter of the polluted area is one of the most important factors in the prediction process. Larger numbers might need more governmental solutions.

# AVERAGE SIZE OF THE PLASTICS

The average size and diameter of plastics are also important for calculation. We can assume that the average size for communal solutions might be 5-10cm, other numbers may require government help for solutions.
